AG.PRD.AGRI.XD,Gross agriculture production index (1999-2001 = 100),3. Development outcomes,Ag. & rural development,"The FAO indices of agricultural production show the relative level of the aggregate volume of agricultural production for each year in comparison with the base period 1999-2001. They are based on the sum of price-weighted quantities of different agricultural commodities produced after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed weighted in a similar manner. The resulting aggregate represents, therefore, disposable production for any use except as seed and feed.  All the indices at the country, regional and world levels are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 1999-2001 average international commodity prices and summed for each year.  To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 1999-2001.  Since the FAO indices are based on the concept of agriculture as a single enterprise, amounts of seed and feed are subtracted from the production data to avoid double counting them, once in the production data and once with the crops or livestock produced from them.  Deductions for seed (in the case of eggs, for hatching) and for livestock and poultry feed apply to both domestically produced and imported commodities.  They cover only primary agricultural products destined to animal feed (e.g. maize, potatoes, milk, etc.). Processed and semi-processed feed items such as bran, oilcakes, meals and molasses have been completely excluded from the calculations at all stages.   should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group “crops” and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group “livestock products”. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed.  The  ”international commodity prices” are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These” international prices”, expressed in so-called”international dollars”, are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single “price” to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unit in which the prices are expressed has no influence on the indices published.  The commodities covered in the computation of indices of agricultural production are all crops and livestock products originating in each country.  Practically all products are covered, with the main exception of fodder crops. The category of food production includes commodities that are considered edible and that contain nutrients.  Accordingly, coffee and tea are excluded along with inedible commodities because, although edible, they have practically no nutritive value.  Aggregates are the sum of available data. 
For some item aggregates, conversion factors are applied to values when calculating totals. Please see item Metadata for the factors at FAOSTAT.  The indices are calculated from production data presented on a calendar year basis.  The FAO indices may differ from those produced by the countries themselves because of differences in concepts of production, coverage, weights, time reference of data and methods of calculation.

AG.PRD.NFOOD.XD,Gross non-food production index (1999-2001 = 100),3. Development outcomes,Ag. & rural development,"Non-food production index covers non-food items.  All the indices at the country, regional and world levels are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 1999-2001 average international commodity prices and summed for each year. To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 1999-2001.  It should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group “crops” and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group “livestock products”. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed.  The”international commodity prices” are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These” international prices”, expressed in so-called”international dollars”, are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single “price” to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unit in which the prices are expressed has no influence on the indices published.  The indices are calculated from production data presented on a calendar year basis.  Aggregates are the sum of available data. 
For some item aggregates, conversion factors are applied to values when calculating totals. Please see item Metadata for the factors at FAOSTAT.  The FAO indices may differ from those produced by the countries themselves because of differences in concepts of production, coverage, weights, time reference of data and methods of calculation.

AGI.OB.XQ,Open Budget Index Overall Country Score,3. Development outcomes,Governance & partnership,"Open Budget Index scores countries from zero to 100, based on a subset of 91 questions from the questionnaire. These questions focus on the public availability of eight key budget documents (with a particular emphasis on the Executive’s Budget Proposal), and on the information they contain. A score of 81-100 indicates that a given country provides extensive information in its budget documents, a score of 61-80 indicates significant information, 41-60 indicates some  information, 21-40 indicates minimal information, and zero-20 indicates scant or no information.
The Open Budget Index rates countries on how open their budget books are to their citizens. The Index assesses the availability of key budget documents, the quantity of information they provide, and the timeliness of their dissemination to citizens in order to provide reliable information on each country’s commitment to open budgeting. It is intended to provide citizens, legislators, and civil society advocates with the comprehensive and practical information needed to gauge a government’s commitment to budget transparency and accountability. The Open Budget Index 2006 was calculated based on detailed questionnaires completed by local experts in 59 participating countries from every continent.  In 2008, based on inputs received from researchers and extensive in-house reviews, the International Budget Partnership (IBP) has made three changes in the methodology applied to its Open Budget Survey, which is the basis for the Open Budget Index (OBI). The first change concerns the timing of the release of the eight key budget documents assessed by the Survey. The second change is the inclusion of the enacted budget in calculating country scores for the OBI. The third change is based on comments received from experts from Brazil and Nigeria that resulted in revisions to the answers of a few questions used to assess these countries.

Data on exports and imports (on a balance of payments basis), international reserves, and current account balances are drawn mainly from the files of the IMF, complemented by World Bank staff estimates. Balance of payments data are presented according to the fifth edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual, which made several adjustments to its presentation of trade statistics. Coverage of goods was expanded to include in imports the value of goods received for processing and repair (on a gross basis). Their subsequent re-export is recorded in exports (also on a gross basis). This approach will cause a country's imports and exports to increase without affecting the balance of goods. In addition, all capital transfers, which were included with current transfers in the fourth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual, are now shown in a separate capital (as opposed to financial) account, and so do not contribute to the current account balance. Data are in current U.S. dollars.

IC.CLS.REC.CD,"Closing a business, recovery rate (cents on the dollar)",3. Development outcomes,Doing business,"The recovery rate is recorded as cents on the dollar recouped by creditors through the bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. The calculation takes into account whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern as well as costs and the loss in value due to the time spent closing down. If the business keeps operating, no value is lost on the initial claim, set at 100 cents on the dollar. If it does not, the initial 100 cents on the dollar are reduced to 70 cents on the dollar. Then the official costs of the insolvency procedure are deducted (1 cent for each percentage of the initial value). Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is taken into account, including the loss of value due to depreciation of the hotel furniture. Consistent with international accounting practice, the depreciation rate for furniture is taken to be 20%. The furniture is assumed to account for a quarter of the total value of assets. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2006 lending rates from the International Monetary Fund’s International Financial Statistics, supplemented with data from central banks.

IC.LGL.FIRE.DURS,"Employing workers, redundancy (weeks of wages)",3.

If the firing cost adds up to 8 or fewer weeks of salary, a score of 0 is assigned for the purposes of calculating the aggregate ease of doing business ranking. If the cost adds up to more than 8 weeks of salary, the score is the number of weeks. One month is recorded as 4 and 1/3 weeks. In Mauritius, for example, an employer is required to give 3 months’ notice before a redundancy termination, and the severance pay for a worker with 20 years of service equals 5 months of wages. No penalty is levied. Altogether, the employer pays the equivalent of 35 weeks of salary to dismiss the worker.  For more information, visit http://www.doingbusiness.org/MethodologySurveys/.

For the first question an answer of yes for workers of any income level gives a score of 10 and means that the rest of the questions do not apply. An answer of yes to question (iv) gives a score of 2. For every other question, if the answer is yes, a score of 1 is assigned; otherwise a score of 0 is given.

A score of 1 is assigned if the maximum cumulative duration of fixed term contracts is less than 3 years; 0.5 if it is 3 years or more but less than 5 years; and 0 if fixed term contracts can last 5 years or more. Finally, a score of 1 is assigned if the ratio of the minimum wage to the average value added per worker is 0.75 or more; 0.67 for a ratio of 0.50 or more but less than 0.75; 0.33 for a ratio of 0.25 or more but less than 0.50; and 0 for a ratio of less than 0.25.

For each of these questions, if the answer is no, the economy is assigned a score of 1; otherwise a score of 0 is assigned. For example, the Czech Republic imposes restrictions on night work (a score of 1) and weekend work (a score of 1), allows 6 day workweeks (a score of 0), permits 50 hour workweeks for 2 months (a score of 0) and requires paid vacation of 20 working days (a score of 0).

“parallel” refers to having been created outside existing country institutional structures. The survey guidance makes a distinction between PIUs and executing agencies and gives three typical features of parallel PIUs: (a) They are accountable to the external funding agencies rather than to the country implementing agencies (ministries, departments, agencies, etc.). (b) Most of the professional staff are appointed by the donor. (c) The salary of PIU personnel often exceeds that of civil-service personnel.
Interpretation of the survey question on this subject was controversial in a number of countries. It is not clear that within countries all donors applied the same criteria with the same degree of rigour, or that across countries the same standards were used. In a number of cases, the descriptive part of the survey return indicates that some donors applied a legalistic criterion of
accountability to the formal executing agency, whereas the National Co-ordinator or other donors would have preferred a greater recognition of the substantive reality of accountability to the donor. It seems possible that some respondents allowed themselves to confuse the definitional question (is the unit “parallel”?) with the aid management question (is the parallelism justified
in terms of the developmental benefits and costs?). Indicators 3 to 12 (but not Indictor 8) are drawn  from the Survey on Monitoring the Paris Declaration for each respective year.  Source: Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (www.oecd.org/dac/effectiveness/monitoring)."

Solid fuels include biomass fuels, such as wood, charcoal, crops or other agricultural waste, dung, shrubs and straw, and coal.  
In estimating solid fuel use for a given year, the methods developed and implemented by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (WHO & UNICEF 2006 ) were followed. Solid fuel information is either extrapolated (single year data point), averaged (two or more years that are spaced four or fewer years apart) or a linear regression is performed when solid fuel use information is available for two or more years that are spaced at least five years apart.  Limitations of the indicator: (a) The indicator uses solid fuel use as a proxy for indoor air pollution, as it is not currently possible to obtain nationally representative samples of indoor concentrations of criteria pollutants, such as small particles and carbon monoxide. (b) The indicator is based on the main type of fuel used for cooking as cooking occupies the largest share of overall household energy needs. However, many households use more than one type of fuel for cooking and, depending on climatic and geographical conditions, heating with solid fuels can also be a contributor to indoor air pollution levels.  Source: Solid fuel use data are routinely collected at the national and sub national levels in most countries using censuses and surveys.

Development outcomes,Trade,"This indicator measures the extent of General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) commitments for all 155 services sub-sectors as classified by the GATS and in the four modes of the GATS. Each entry in the country’s schedule is assigned scores based on its relative restrictiveness, using a criteria set out by Bernard Hoekman’s methodology.  That resulted in 1,240 scores, ranging from 0 (unbound or no commitments) to 100 (completely liberalized), with an intermediate value of 50 for partial commitments. A simple average of the subsectoral scores were used to generate aggregate sectoral scores (for the 12 main services sectors as classified by the GATS), modes scores, and market access and national treatment scores. The overall 12 GATS commitment index is a simple average of the sectoral indices.  Disaggregated indices are available for Market Access and National Treatment and for twelve subsectors: business services, communication services, construction and engineering services, distribution services, educational services, environmental services, financial services, health services, tourism services, recreational and cultural services, transport services, and other services.

UPP.INS.AUTO.XQ,Institutionalized autocracy,3. Development outcomes,Governance & partnership," ""Authoritarian regime"" in Western political discourse is a pejorative term for some very diverse kinds of political systems whose common properties are a lack of regularized political competition and concern for political freedoms. The term Autocracy is used and defined operationally in terms of the presence of a distinctive set of political characteristics.  In mature form, autocracies sharply restrict or suppress competitive political participation. Their chief executives are chosen in a regularized process of selection within the political elite, and once in office they exercise power with few institutional constraints. Most modern autocracies also exercise a high degree of directiveness over social and economic activity, but we regard this as a function of political ideology and choice, not a defining property of autocracy. Social democracies also exercise relatively high degrees of directiveness. We prefer to leave open for empirical investigation the question of how Autocracy, Democracy, and directiveness (performance) have covaried over time.

An eleven-point Autocracy scale is constructed additively.  Operational indicator of autocracy is derived from codings of the competitiveness of political participation using the following weights:
 
Authority Coding      Scale Weight
Competitiveness of Executive Recruitment (XRCOMP):

(1) Selection     +2
Openness of Executive Recruitment (XROPEN):
only if XRCOMP is coded Selection (1)

(1) Closed     +1
(2) Dual/designation    +1

Constraints on Chief Executive (XCONST):
(1) Unlimited authority    +3
(2) Intermediate category     +2
(3) Slight to moderate limitations    +1

Regulation of participation (PARREG):
(4) Restricted      +2
(3) Sectarian      +1

Competitiveness of Participation (PARCOMP):
(1) Repressed      +2
(2) Suppressed      +1

The logic of this ""institutionalized autocracy"" scale is similar to that of the institutionalized democracy scale, below, and it is subject to the same kinds of operational redefinition to suit different theoretical purposes. Note that the two scales do not share any categories in common. Nonetheless many polities have mixed authority traits, and thus can have middling scores on both
Autocracy and Democracy scales.

UPP.INS.DEMO.XQ,Institutionalized democracy,3. Development outcomes,Governance & partnership,"Democracy is conceived as three essential, interdependent elements. One is the presence of institutions and procedures through which citizens can express effective preferences about alternative policies and leaders. Second is the existence of institutionalized constraints on the exercise of power by the executive. Third is the guarantee of civil liberties to all citizens in their daily lives and in acts of political participation. Other aspects of plural democracy, such as the rule of law, systems of checks and balances, freedom of the press, and so on are means to, or specific manifestations of, these general principles. We do not include coded data on civil liberties.
